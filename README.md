## Introduction

> Live Score App, an application that delivers real-time sports scores using reactive programming principles. This project showcases the power of Spring Boot's reactive 🍃 capabilities combined with a modern frontend with Vaadin's Hilla ⚛️ project.

💡 This application is not business oriented and my focus is mostly on technical part, I just want to implement a sample app that uses reactive programming with Spring Boot to put in practice what I have learned.

🌀 This Application is in-progress and I will add some improvements and features over time 🌀

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To demonstrate the implementation of reactive programming in a real-world application.
2. To create a user-friendly interface for accessing live sports scores.
3. To serve as an educational resource for developers interested in reactive programming with Spring Boot.

## Reactive Programming with Spring Boot

### What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a paradigm focused on building asynchronous, non-blocking, and event-driven applications that can scale effectively. It's particularly well-suited for applications that deal with streams of data or require high concurrency.

Key concepts in reactive programming include:
- 🔄 Asynchronous data streams
- 🚫 Non-blocking operations
- 🧮 Functional-style programming

### Why Use Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming offers several advantages:

1. **Improved Scalability**: Reactive applications can handle more concurrent users with less hardware.
2. **Enhanced Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations ensure that the application remains responsive under high load.
3. **Resilience**: Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms make reactive systems more robust.
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Reactive systems can do more with less, optimizing CPU and memory usage.

### How Spring Boot Implements Reactive Programming

Spring Boot leverages the Project Reactor library to implement reactive programming. Key components include:

- **WebFlux**: Spring's reactive-stack web framework, an alternative to Spring MVC.
- **Reactive Streams**: A specification for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure.
- **Reactor Core**: Provides reactive types like Mono (for 0 or 1 element) and Flux (for 0 to N elements).

In Live Score App, we use these technologies to create a reactive pipeline from the data source to the client, ensuring efficient and scalable real-time updates.

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The application periodically fetches live score data from an external API [API-FOOTBALL](https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com) from RapidAPI using WebClient, a non-blocking HTTP client.
2. **Data Processing**: Incoming data is processed reactively using Flux and Mono operators.
5. **Frontend Integration**: The frontend, built with React and TypeScript, consumes the reactive API and updates the UI in real-time.
